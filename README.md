# Jemena planned outages — auto-updating map + client impact

A self-updating interactive map showing Jemena's planned electricity outages
(Melbourne's north and west), with automatic identification of affected
client sites.

A GitHub Action scrapes Jemena's website once a day, matches each affected
street to its OpenStreetMap geometry, identifies which of your tracked
clients are in those areas, and publishes everything to GitHub Pages.

The map URL stays the same forever; contents refresh every morning.

## What's published

Every morning, three things land on the Pages site:

- **`/`** — the interactive map with shaded streets, suburb pins, and client
  markers (definitely affected in red, possibly affected in amber, others
  in grey if you toggle the layer on)
- **`/affected.html`** — a sortable, filterable table of impacted clients
  with their contact details. Linked from a button on the main map.
- **`/affected.csv`** — the same data as a spreadsheet for emails, mail
  merge, etc.

## Editing the client list

The list of clients you want to track lives in `clients.csv` at the repo
root. Open it on GitHub, click the pencil icon to edit, paste rows in,
commit. The next daily run picks them up.

Required columns (header row must be present):

    name,address,suburb,postcode,category,contact_name,contact_phone,contact_email,notes

Notes:

- `name` and `suburb` are required for a row to be processed.
- `address` should be just the street part (e.g. `123 Sydney Rd`). The
  scraper geocodes each new address once via OpenStreetMap and caches
  the result in `.cache/clients.json` so re-runs are instant.
- `category` is freeform — what shows up as a coloured chip on the map.
  Common ones: Retail, Hospitality, Manufacturing, Healthcare.
- All contact fields are optional but they're what the affected page
  shows when something needs a phone call.

In addition to your list, the pipeline pulls major chains from
OpenStreetMap automatically (refreshed weekly): McDonald's, Hungry Jack's,
KFC, Aldi, Coles, Woolworths, IGA, Bunnings, Officeworks, Kmart, Target,
Big W, and shopping centres. Edit the `CHAINS` list in `scrape.py` to
add or remove.

## Affected logic

A client appears in the affected list if either:

- **Definitely affected**: their address's street name + suburb appears
  exactly in the day's outage list, OR
- **Possibly affected**: they're within 200m of a shaded street segment

Both are shown separately so the team can prioritise. Definite goes red on
the map and gets a red chip on the affected page; possible goes amber.

The 200m default is set by `BUFFER_METRES` near the top of `scrape.py`.

## Operational stuff

### When the data changes
- Daily run at 06:00 AEST (07:00 AEDT) — see `.github/workflows/update.yml`.
- The chain list refreshes weekly to avoid hammering OpenStreetMap.
- Every run saves debug snapshots to `docs/_last_scrape.png` and
  `docs/_last_scrape_raw.json` so failures are diagnosable.

### When something breaks
- Failed run → check the Actions tab → click the red run → look at the
  failing step. Most likely cause is Jemena changing their page markup;
  the debug PNG and HTML get committed even on failure.
- Failed geocode for a specific client row → that client just doesn't
  appear on the map until you fix the address. No knock-on effect.
- Overpass down → all three mirrors are tried in sequence. If all fail,
  the workflow fails for the day, retries tomorrow.

### Cost
Free. GitHub Actions gives 2,000 free minutes/month for public repos
(this run uses ~5/day = ~150/month). GitHub Pages is free. OSM/Nominatim/
Overpass are free at our request rates. CARTO basemap tiles are free for
non-commercial use up to 75k tiles/month.

## Setup, first time

Same as before:

1. Create the repo, upload these files
2. Settings → Pages → deploy from `main` / `/docs`
3. Actions tab → enable workflows → run "Update Jemena outages map" once
4. Your live URL: `https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`

If you're upgrading an existing v1 repo, you only need to:

1. Upload the new `scrape.py`
2. Upload the new `template.html`
3. Upload the new `affected_template.html`
4. Upload the new `clients.csv` (at repo root)
5. Trigger a manual workflow run

Existing caches (`.cache/suburbs.json`) carry over. New caches
(`.cache/clients.json`, `.cache/chains.json`) get created on first run.

## Local testing

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m playwright install chromium
python scrape.py
```

Output goes to `docs/`. Open `docs/index.html` in a browser to verify.
